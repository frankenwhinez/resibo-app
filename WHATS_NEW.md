## Why These Changes?

Based on research of best expense trackers (YNAB, Mint, PocketGuard, Goodbudget):

✅ **8-15 categories** is the sweet spot (we have 10 + unlimited custom)
✅ **Split Food into Groceries/Dining** (covered with better keywords)
✅ **Health is essential** (medicine, doctor visits are common)
✅ **Personal care matters** (haircuts, grooming, etc.)
✅ **Custom categories** for personalization
✅ **Manual override** when automation fails
✅ **Export capability** for data portability
